### The challenge

  -- You should have a page title in an h1 element with an id of title
  -- You should have a short explanation in a p element with an id of description
  -- You should have a form element with an id of survey-form
  -- Inside the form element, you are required to enter your name in an input field that has an id of name and a type of text
  -- Inside the form element, you are required to enter your email in an input field that has an id of email
  -- If you enter an email that is not formatted correctly, you will see an HTML5 validation error
  -- Inside the form, you can enter a number in an input field that has an id of number
  -- The number input should not accept non-numbers, either by preventing you from typing them or by showing an HTML5 validation error (depending on your browser).
  -- If you enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error
  -- For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label"
  -- For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see placeholder text that gives a description or instructions for each field
  -- Inside the form element, you should have a select dropdown element with an id of dropdown and at least two options to choose from
  -- Inside the form element, you can select an option from a group of at least two radio buttons that are grouped using the name attribute
  -- Inside the form element, you can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute
  -- Inside the form element, you are presented with a textarea for additional comments
